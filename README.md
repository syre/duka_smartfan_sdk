# Introduction

This is a Python module for making a connection to a [Duka Smartfan Wifi](https://dukaventilation.dk/produkter/ventilatorer-styringer-og-tilbehoer/smartfan-wi-fi).

Forked from and heavily inspired by the great [dingusdk dukaonesdk package](https://github.com/dingusdk/dukaonesdk) for connecting with a Duka One.

The primary goal for this module is to make an interface from Home Assistant to Duka Smartfan Wifi.

The module implements:

* On/Off
* Boost mode
* Notification when a state changes. 
 
## Example

See the example.py file

Have a look at http://www.dingus.dk/ for the original implementation.

## Other compatible devices

There are other devices for which this package should also work:
* Blauberg Smart Wi-fi
